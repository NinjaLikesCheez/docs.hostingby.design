Automated recaptcha solver

## Initial remarks

As many might know Flaresolverr poses a significant problem on the resources front, we have been working on a solution to support the app directly on our servers but we've come to terms that won't be possible. As a result we have instead opted to host a global instance.

## How to Access

Flaresolverr is available on the domain: http://flare.itsby.design and on port 8000 - Adding it to your favorite app is as easy as inserting the url in the fields required by the app.

## Limitations

As Flaresolverr is resource heavy we are running a very strict firewall infront, this is to ensure that purely our servers are using the instance - This means that the instance is ONLY available from our servers.

Should you against expectation not be able to connect to it from our servers then please let us know by dropping in a ticket!

To check your current disk space usage and available space, simply login to your webui and look at the lower left corner as detailed in the screenshot below:Â

In this case the plugin shows that 7% of the total disk space is in use, if you hover the mouse over the rectangel it will show an extra set of details, which in this case shows 277.6 GB/300.00 GB which indicates that amount of available disk space.

So to sum up, the above details show: 7% of the total disk space used, with 277GB available space for new downloads.

If you have any questions relating to this, or the diskspace plugin is not working, simply let our support team know.

## Setting up a Guest FTP Service

First, you have to elevate to root user with `sudo su -` and then inputting your password. 

When you’re root, you need to download the GuestFTP script: `wget https://hnielsen.eu/files/guestftp.sh` 

Now you need to make the script executable with `chmod +x guestftp.sh`.

Once the file is executable, you can run it. The syntax for running is as follows. ./guestftp.sh username password /path/to/folder/

So for example to give username ”test”, with the password ”test” access to folder /home/test/test/, you would run the command as follows:
`./guestftp.sh test test /home/test/test/`

After the script has ran fully, you can check that the service is up and running with `service guest-ftp status` and it should say that the service is active.

The port to use to be able to connect is 2121.
